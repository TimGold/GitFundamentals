# git commit

The command `git commit` will take all tracked changes (items added with [git add](./ADD.md)) and package them in what is called a commit.

Commits come with commit messages that are required for each commit. You add a message to a commit command by using the `-m` flag followed by a message in quotes.

A commit message _can_ be anything, but best practice dictates that you should use that message to indicate the changes included in the commit.
